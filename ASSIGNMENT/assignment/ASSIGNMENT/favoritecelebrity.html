            <p>
                Adele has won 16 Grammys out of 25 total nominations. Her most recent win was her fourth Best Solo Pop
                Performance trophy for “Easy on Me” in 2023.
                Beyond the Grammys, Adele has a host of other accolades. Her first album 19 earned the singer the
                distinction of being named the “Sound of 2008” by the BBC. That same year, she earned the Critics
                Choice prize at the BRIT Awards. In 2022, the singer took a step closer to EGOT status. Adele: One Night
                Only, a two-hour televised concert at Los Angeles Griffiths Observatory and an interview with Oprah
                Winfrey, earned the musical powerhouse the Emmy for Outstanding Prerecorded Variety Special. During the
                concert, Adele helped orchestrate a successful surprise marriage proposal between two fans.
