            <h2>Native Peoples</h2>
            <p>When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the Tonkawa tribe. Comanches and Lipan Apaches also traveled in the region. Though they came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions, few settlements were established for several centuries.</p>
