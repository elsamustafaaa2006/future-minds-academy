    <h2>The first three horizontal pictures show sightseeings in London,UK.</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><b><i>Big ben</i></b></li>
        <p>The Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower, commonly called Big Ben, are among London's most iconic
            landmarks and must-see London attractions. <br> Technically, Big Ben is the name given to the massive bell
            inside
            the clock tower, which weighs more than 13 tons (13,760 kg).</p>
        <li><b><i>London Bridge</i></b></li>
        <p>Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road crossing of the Thames downstream of
            Kingston upon Thames.<br> London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and
            songs
        </p>
        <li><b><i>Buckingham Palace</i></b></li>
        <p>Buckingham Palace is very much a working building and the centrepiece of the UK's constitutional monarchy.
            <br>
            Serving as the venue for many royal events and ceremonies from entertaining foreign Heads of States to
            celebrating achievement at Investitures and receptions.</p>
